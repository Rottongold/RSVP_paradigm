## Rapid Serial Visual Presentation on Psychopy

This is a quick RSVP demo on psychopy displaying a few puns stimulus for my project. Each word in the stimulus will be presented for 200ms followed by a fixation cross of 200ms in between. After the stimulus is finished presenting, subject will be prompted to answer a comprehension question to examine whether they properly understand the puns.
